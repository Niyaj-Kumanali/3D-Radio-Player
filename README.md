# Interactive Radio Player

The Interactive Radio Player is an engaging web application that simulates the experience of using a vintage radio. It features a visually appealing design with interactive animations implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click the "Play" button to activate the radio player, which comes to life with dynamic animations for the radio, shadows, and buttons. The radio player also includes a cover animation effect. Additionally, users can toggle the sound on and off, with corresponding visual feedback. This project serves as a creative and educational example of how to build interactive web elements using web technologies.
